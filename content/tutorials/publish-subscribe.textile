h2. Step 1 - Install Ably

blang[javascript].
  To start using Ably you first need to include the Ably library in your browser. We recommend that you use the client library from our CDN as it will always be up to date. The client library must be instanced with an API key ("which you can find in your dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030502-setting-up-and-managing-api-keys), or using "token authentication":/general/authentication#token-authentication. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  Include the code below just before your closing your HTML @</body>@ tag.

  ```[javascript]
    <!-- Include the Ably Library -->
    <script src="//cdn.ably.io/lib/ably-0.8.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Instance the Ably library  -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var realtime = Ably.Realtime.new(apiKey);
    </script>
  ```

blang[ruby].
  To start using Ably you first need to install the Ably RubyGem. The RubyGem can be installed as follows:

  ```[sh]
  gem install ably
  ```

  Or if using bundler, simply add the following to your Gemfile and run @bundle install@:

  ```[ruby]
  gem 'ably'
  ```

  The client library must be instanced with an API key ("which you can find in your dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030502-setting-up-and-managing-api-keys), or using "token authentication":/general/authentication#token-authentication. In this example, we use an API key for simplicity.

  The Ruby realtime library uses "EventMachine":https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine to run the client library within an event loop. Add the following to a file named @server.rb@ to start Ably inside an EventMachine reactor:

  ```[javascript]
    require 'ably'

    EventMachine.run do
      ably = Ably::Realtime.new(key: api_key)
    end
  ```

h2. Step 2 - Subscribe to messages

Now that the library is installed, you can subscribe to data published on any channel. Every channel is isolated for each other and you can use any arbitrary number of channels to publish your data. For example, if building a news feed, you may want one channel for politics named "politics", and another for sport named "sport"

blang[javascript].
  ```[javascript]
    var channel = ably.channels.get("sport");
    channel.subscribe(function(msg) {
      console.log(msg.data);
    });
  ```

blang[ruby].
  ```[ruby]
    channel = ably.channels.get('sport')
    channel.subscribe do |msg|
      puts msg.data
    end
  ```
